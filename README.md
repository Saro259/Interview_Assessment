# Interview_Assessment
The problem question is a part of the online assessment conducted by Exalens. 

The problem statement and the solution is provided in master threads.

The approach for the solution can be as follows:

To create a hashmap to keep the accountability of the current blocks and its list.

To keep up a variable max_dist which changes according to the requirements.

Now for every block, go through every requirement and find the closest block that satisfies that requirements and change max_Dist value for that block with a minimum of the current object and maximum distance for any requirement. 

At the end return the index of the result.
